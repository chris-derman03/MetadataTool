Works on Linux (my machine was WSL2 Ubuntu 24.something it doesnt matter yet)

Download dependecies from downloads.txt

## Images - v1.0.0

```
cd ./Images
```

Current Version File Support: ```.png``` ```.jpg```

For other file types: go convert it online or something idk

```
./run
cd ./out
```

Your output is a ```.csv``` in ```Images/out/``` 

There's a different file for each image file type. sorry lol

Do whatever you want with it or open the boiler plate in ```Images/dev```
